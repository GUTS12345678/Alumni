# Add User & Permissions Page Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Add User Button Not Working
**Problem:** The "Add User" button in User Management page had no functionality - it was just a static button.

**Solution:**
- Created a comprehensive Add User dialog with form fields:
  - Full Name (required)
  - Email Address (required, validated)
  - Password (required, minimum 8 characters)
  - Role (dropdown: Alumni, Admin, Super Admin)
  - Status (dropdown: Active, Inactive, Suspended)
- Added form validation (client-side and server-side)
- Created `handleAddUser()` function to handle form submission
- Created backend API endpoint `POST /api/v1/admin/users`
- Added proper loading states and error handling

### 2. Permissions Page Not Loading
**Problem:** Permissions page showed "Failed to load permissions data" because backend API endpoints didn't exist.

**Solution:**
Created 4 missing backend API endpoints in `AdminController.php`:

1. **GET /api/v1/admin/roles**
   - Returns all system roles (super_admin, admin, alumni)
   - Includes user counts for each role
   - Shows permissions assigned to each role

2. **GET /api/v1/admin/permissions**
   - Returns all system permissions
   - Categorized by module (Dashboard, User Management, Alumni Management, etc.)
   - Shows display names and descriptions

3. **GET /api/v1/admin/users/with-roles**
   - Returns users with their assigned roles
   - Includes user status and last login information
   - Limited to 50 most recent users

4. **GET /api/v1/admin/permissions/stats**
   - Returns statistics about roles and permissions
   - Shows total roles, permissions, and users
   - Identifies most used role
   - Lists permission categories with counts
